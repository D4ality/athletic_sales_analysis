Pandas Module 5 Challenge Part 2
Received guidance and assistance from the TA, Xpert, and CHATGPT platforms. Accomplished over 60% of the challenge considering time constraints/work balance.
Experienced errors mentioning 'cannot assign function to call' during the third section of the step. Attempted to research remedies, but had difficulites finding an answer that would completely solve the issus. The solutions provided online appeared vague and ambiguous. I understand that it mentions something about not assigning a variable to the line, however in this case I had already created one for the dataframe at stake. I am not entirely sure as to what the issue would be as it does not allow me to progress further into the other consecutive steps.
